There is a book that has had more of an impact on the history of human thought than any other piece of literature. Though its stories are well known, the true meaning behind what it says can sometimes get lost. The bible is a huge book that contains many different messages and teachings. 
But what if I told you that the ancient biblical book is actually a self-help book? No joke. 

The Bible is one of the earliest and best-known self-help books. In other words, it was written thousands of years ago as a how-to guide to living your best life. What was considered to be your best life at the time is probably different than most of what they would consider your best life today. After all, that was thousands of years ago and society has most certainly evolved since the Bible was written.

Whether you like it or not, the Bible is still jam-packed full of wisdom we can apply to our lives today to be happier, find more connections, and fulfill our potential as humans. The message continues to resonate with over 2 billion people (as per the last census), so it must be doing something right.

Today, I’m going to share with you my modern understanding of the bible and how its teachings apply to our lives. If you want to understand the bible better, read on my friend.

## What is God?

Before we get into the stories in the bible, let's get on the same page about some things. For starters, what "God" actually is.

A lot of people think that God is an all-powerful being in the clouds with a beard. This is simply not true. God was never human, and it's wrong to think of him as a human being.

God is the name given to a force that is believed to be responsible for the origin of the universe. It is also used to refer to the supreme being. This concept or idea has evolved and expanded through many cultures, religions and philosophies. 

## We are part of nature and the universe that encompass it

Trying to define God is like trying to define energy; it is impossible because you cannot grasp it in your hand. It is beyond our five senses that we use to perceive the world around us. 

The power of creation can be seen in all of nature, from a tiny seed growing into a magnificent tree, but we cannot see the life force within that makes this possible. We only see the physical manifestation of this life force. A rose may blossom in full beauty before our eyes, but we do not see the invisible force within it that allows it to grow and bloom. Our limited senses allow us to perceive only a small part of creation, so we cannot comprehend God as He really is.

You might ask, "If God's power lies beyond our perception, how can we know its existence?" The answer lies in what happens when you try to deny that God exists. You cannot escape God because He is everywhere and everything. If you want evidence of God's existence, look at yourself in a mirror.

## God represents the true self

There is a "god" in each of us. This god-energy is the universe, it's the true self inside of us. Through expressing that true self we are allowing ourselves to get closer to "Heaven". The farther apart we are, the more we are in "Hell," where life feels empty and unfulfilling. That is what hell actually is.

The Bible is not about religion. It's about the relationship between you and your true self.

This energy can be called by many names: The Universe, Intuition, Inner Knowing, The Inner Guide, Faith, Spirituality, and more. Each of these words represents a different side of the same thing we call God. 

What does it mean to really believe in God? It means believing that there is something inside of us that is guiding us to the next steps in our lives. It means trusting that this inner voice knows what it's doing, even when we don't know why things are happening.

The Bible is a guide to connect you to your higher power. It shows you how to tap into this energy as it flows through you on a daily basis. As you learn to connect to your true self on a daily basis, you will experience a greater sense of peace, purpose, and well-being in your life.

## Jesus Christ represents man becoming one with his true self

The Bible's purpose is to show people how to become one with their true self, as opposed to the false self, which is what most of us are. When someone is in touch with his true self, he becomes Christ-like because love and compassion flow through him.

The only sin is not loving others or yourself. When you love others, you love God. And when you love yourself, you don't want to do anything that would harm yourself. When you act out of that love, God acts through you. You don't have to worry about whether what you're doing is good or bad; just follow your intuition and it will lead you into a life filled with peace and joy.

To become one with your true self means that you have discovered that you are not your body or your mind or your personality or your emotions; you are pure awareness. You are spirit. You are God.

## What is sin?

I like to think of sin as the ultimate selfish act. It's all about doing what you want, even if it goes against the will of God, or your true self. It's essentially humans exercising their free will in a way that disobeys God.

The story of Adam and Eve is a metaphor for man living their perfect ideal life in the Garden of Eden, until they decide to disobey god's command by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. This is a symbol that they have now gained free will, and choose to do as they please rather than follow god's will.

Sin is not limited to the violation of divine laws, although it certainly encompasses that. More broadly, sin can be understood as any action on the part of man that falls short of his highest ideal and plunges him into self-contemplation or self-absorption, thus opening him up to egotistical pride and delusion.

A more modern example would be when you have an important test coming up, and your better judgment tells you that it would be smart to go home early, but you exercise free will and decide to stay out late and get an extra few drinks, ending up hungover and crashing your test the next day.

## The metaphor of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ exists in all of us. We all can be our highest potential, and live up to our true selves.

When Jesus was crucified, it was a metaphor for when we fail to live up to our true self, because we are putting our own perfect self on the cross and having it bear the burden of our mistakes.

The sacrifice he makes for us is a reminder that we have a choice in all of our actions, and the consequences of us failing to live up to our potential can lead to terrible things happening. 

Jesus understands that man does not realize the consequences of their sin, and asks "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” 

Even understanding the wrongs that man is commiting, Jesus does not seek to judge and punish man, but instead asks for their forgiveness. He knows that humans are not fully aware of the sins that are causing havoc in their lives, and the lives of those around them.

Meaning we can't destroy ourselves and give up on who we are because of the previous mistakes we've made. Even if our actions have led to horrible things happening, we can still ask for forgiveness and redeem ourselves to live up to a higher ideal.

## The Law of Attraction

The concept of the Law of Attraction is simple. What we think about most often, and focus on with our feelings, will become a reality for us.

This is an idea thats said in many places in the Bible. Jesus tells us to feel we have already received our desires: "Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours." 

The Bible repeats this message in many places stating "you will receive whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe." It also says "ask and it shall be given unto you; seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you."

This idea is controversial because it seems so farfetched — thinking something makes it so?

Even without the metaphysical idea that we create our reality through thinking, there are many practical benefits to this method. Telling yourself that you already have what you want not only helps focus your mind on the positive outcome, but also helps release any negative feelings of doubt or frustration associated with trying to get what you want. 

Once you free yourself of those negative feelings, you can begin to open your awareness to opportunities as they present themselves to you, and ultimately take the actions that lead you to what you desire.

## We are all connected and we are here to help each other

The truth of the matter is, what you put out into the universe will eventually come back to you in some form. Whether it be in a good or bad way. This is why the Bible says, "Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap."

Jesus taught this as well, reminding us of the dangers of putting negative things in the world: "Judge not and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.", 

And encouraging us to put love out into the world so that it comes back to us, that "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.", and to “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,”

The belief in karma is very much alive today and can be found in many different religions including Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Even though most of these religions have different beliefs about how karma works and what it means for our individual lives, there is one common thread among them: What we do to others is what we receive for ourselves. 

Karma is the universal law of cause and effect. It states that every action has a reaction. This doesn't mean that if someone hurts you, they're going to get hurt back in return. It just means that when we treat others poorly, we have less of a chance of being treated well in return. And when we treat others with kindness and respect, we have more of a chance of being treated well in return.

## Conclusion

In other words, the bible is a book about you. It teaches you about your true self, which is the closest thing to God and the ultimate source of fulfillment. And if you want more fulfillment and happiness in your life, setting yourself free from false egos and desires is the way to get it.

The bible is an old book that was written thousands of years ago. But the main message it provides is still valid today. For instance, God is our true self, but we tend to hold on to certain ideas or beliefs that define who we are as a person. When we are close to being our true self then life seems easier and more fulfilling.

The bible offers a strikingly simple philosophy: Love God. Be kind to others. Love yourself. Do good things.
